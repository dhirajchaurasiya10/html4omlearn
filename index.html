    <p>With HTML5 web storage, websites can store data on a user's local computer.
        Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript cookies to achieve this functionality.

        The Advantages of Web Storage
        - More secure
        - Faster
        - Stores a larger amount of data
        - Stored data is not sent with every server request
        Local storage is per domain. All pages from one domain can
        store and access the same data.</p>
    <br>
    <p>- Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
        - Local Storage stores data with no expiration date <br></p>
    <p>
        In HTML5, the Geolocation API is used to obtain the user's geographical location.

        Since this can compromise user privacy, the option is not available unless the user approves it.
        Geolocation is much more accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
        The drag and drop feature lets you "grab" an object and drag it to a different location.
        To make an element draggable, just set the draggable attribute to true:
        <!--<img draggable="true" />-->
    </p>
    <p>


        To draw shapes with SVG, you first need to create an SVG element tag with two attributes: width and height.
        svg width="1000" height="1000"></svg>
        HTML
        To create a circle, add a <circle> tag:
            - cx pushes the center of the circle further to the right of the screen
            - cy pushes the center of the circle further down from the top of the screen
            - r defines the radius
            - fill determines the color of our circle
            - stroke adds an outline to the circle

    </p>
    <p>
        <svg width="2000" height="2000">
            <circle cx="80" cy="80" r="50" fill="green" />
        </svg>
    </p>
    <p>
        Shape Animations


SVG animations can be created using the <animate> element.

The example below creates a rectangle that will change its position in 3 seconds and will then repeat the animation twice:
attributeName: Specifies which attribute will be affected by the animation
from: Specifies the starting value of the attribute
to: Specifies the ending value of the attribute
dur: Specifies how long the animation runs (duration)
fill: Specifies whether or not the attribute's value should return to its initial value when the animation is finished (Values: "remove" resets the value; "freeze" keeps the “to value”)
repeatCount: Specifies the repeat count of the animation

In the example above, the rectangle changes its x attribute from 0 to 300 in 3 seconds.
To repeat the animation indefinitely, use the value "indefinite" for the repeatCount attribute.
    </p>
    <svg width="1000" height="250">
        <rect width="150" height="150" fill="orange">
            <animate attributeName="x" from="0" to="300"
          dur="3s" fill="freeze" repeatCount="2"/> 
        </rect>
    </svg>
    <p>
        <svg width="500" height="500">
            <path d="M 0 0 L200 200 L200 0 Z" style="stroke:#000;  fill:none;" />
            </svg>
    </p>
    <div id="intro">
        <p> This paragraph is in the intro section.</p>
    </div>
    <p> This paragraph is not in the intro section.</p>
    <div>
        <p class="first">This is a paragraph</p>
        <p> This is the second paragraph. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="first"> This is not in the intro section</p>
    <p> The second paragraph is not in the intro section. </p>
    <p>
        The text-shadow Property


The text-shadow property adds shadow to text.
It takes four values: the first value defines the distance of the shadow in the x (horizontal) direction, the second value sets the distance in the y (vertical) direction, the third value defines the blur of the shadow, and the fourth value sets the color.

The HTML:
<h1>Text-shadow example</h1>
HTML
The CSS:
In the example above, we created a shadow using the following parameters:
5px – the X-coordinate
2px – the Y-coordinate
4px – the blur radius
grey – the color of the shadow
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><hr>

The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. For example, it can be used to make text appear with each word capitalized.

The HTML:
<p class="capitalize">
    The value capitalize transforms the first 
    character in each word to uppercase; 
    all other characters remain unaffected.
</p>
<p><br><hr>letter-spacingfor the space in letters and word spacing for word-space in the words <br><hr>
    

The word-spacing property specifies the space between words in a text. Just like the letter-spacing property, you can set the word-spacing values as normal, length, and inherit.

The HTML:
<p class="normal">This paragraph has no additional word-spacing applied.</p>
<p class="px">This paragraph is word-spaced at 30px.</p>
HTML
The CSS: <br><hr>
<p class="first">
    Border color has been created using <strong>color name.</strong>
</p>
<p class="second">
    Border color has been created using <strong>Hex values.</strong> 
</p>
<p class="third">
    Border color has been created using <strong>RGB values.</strong> 
</p>
</p>
<p>The list style property : <br>
    ul { <br>
    list-style-type : square;   <br>
    list-style-position : outside; <br>
    list-style-image : none;        <br>
    } OR It Can Also Be Written as  <br>
    ul {                            <br>
        list-style : square outside none; <br>
    }                               <br>

</p>
<p>
    
The look of an HTML table can be greatly improved with CSS.

The border-collapse property specifies whether the table borders are collapsed into a single border or separated as default. If the borders are separate, the border-spacing property can be used to change the spacing.

The HTML:
<table border="1">
   <tr>
     <td>Red</td>
     <td>Green</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Yellow</td>
   </tr><br>
   The CSS: <br> 
   table { <br>
    border-collapse : separate; <br>
    border-spacing : 20px 40px; <br>
   } <br>
</table>
This is how it would look like after css effect: 
<img src="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2637" alt="img">
</p>
<p>
    The caption-side Property


The caption-side property specifies the position of a table caption. The values can be set as top or bottom.
In the example below, we specify the placement of a table caption to top.

The HTML:
<table border="1">
<caption>Some of Our Courses</caption>
<tr>
  <th>Course name</th>
  <th>Lessons</th>
  <th>Quizzes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C++</td>
  <td>81</td>
  <td>363</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>JavaScript</td>
  <td>48</td>
  <td>144</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>HTML</td>
  <td>38</td>
  <td>119</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>CSS</td>
  <td>70</td>
  <td>174</td>
</tr>
</table>
The css would be :  <br> caption { <br> caption-side: top; <br> } <br>
& output would be <img src="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2638" alt="">
</p>
<p>
    The empty-cells Property


The empty-cells property specifies whether or not to display borders and background on empty cells in a table.
Possible values are:
show: the borders of an empty cell are rendered
hide: the borders of an empty cell are not drawn

Here is the empty-cells property that is used to hide borders of empty cells in the <table> element.

The HTML:
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>CSS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JavaScript</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
css: <br> table { <br> border-collapse: separate; <br>
     empty-cells: hide; <br> } <br>
     & output: 
     <img src="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2639" alt="">
</p>
<p>
    
The table-layout specifies how the width of table columns is calculated. The possible values are:
auto - when column or cell width are not explicitly set, the column width will be in proportion to the amount of content in the cells that make up the column
fixed - when column or cell width are not explicitly set, the column width will not be affected by the amount of content in the cells that make up the column.

The table layout is set to auto by default.
The example below shows the difference between auto and fixed.

The HTML:
<p>Table-layout is set to <strong>auto</strong></p>
<table class="auto">
  <tr>
    <td width=“10%">500.000.000.000.000</td>
    <td width="90%">20.000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Table-layout is set to <strong>fixed</strong></p>
<table class="fixed">
  <tr>
    <td width="10%">500.000.000.000.000</td>
    <td width="90%">20.000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
css : table { <br> border-collapse: separate <br> width: 100% <br>
border: 1px solid gray; <br> } <br>
td {
     border: 1 px solid gray; <br> 
}
table.auto { <br>table-layout: auto <br> } <br>
table.fixed { <br>table-layout: fixed <br> } <br>
<img src="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2640" alt="">

    Setting Styles to Links


Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g., color, font-family, background, etc.).
In addition, links can be styled differently, depending on what state they are in. The following pseudo selectors are available:
a:link - defines the style for normal unvisited links
a:visited - defines the style for visited links
a:active - a link becomes active once you click on it
a:hover - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it

The example below creates a link that will change the style when the mouse is moved over it.

The HTML:
<p><a href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank">
   This link is hovered when we mouse over it
</a></p>
css: <br> a: hover { <br> color: red; <br> } <br>
note: When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules: <br>
- a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited <br>
- a:active MUST come after a:hover <br>
</p>
<p>By default the links are underlined by browser <br>
    to remove the underline <b> text-decoration </b> is used. <br>
    css: <br> a:link { <br>
        text-decoration: none; <br>
    } <br>
    The following properties are used to control the look and feel of links: <br>
<b>border:none</b> - removes border from images with links <br>
 <b>outline:none </b> - removes the dotted border on clicked lines in IE <br>
</p>
<p>css allows to set desired cursor style when your mouse is hovered
    code: <span style="cursor:help;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you need help?</span><br>
    <img src="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2983" alt="">
